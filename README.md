## Employment Management System (MERN )

This project is a full-stack MERN application (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) designed to streamline employee administration by integrating core HR functions such as attendance tracking, leave management, and payroll processing into a single platform.

I created this system as a practice project to strengthen my full-stack development skills, particularly in:

- Designing relational database schemas with MySQL to store employee records, attendance logs, leave requests, and payroll data.

- Building RESTful APIs using Express.js and Node.js for CRUD operations and business logic.

- Developing a responsive React frontend for HR managers and employees to interact with the system intuitively.

- Implementing authentication & role-based access control to separate admin and employee functionalities.

- Practicing state management with Redux (or Context API) and API integration between backend and frontend.

This project simulates a real-world HR solution, allowing me to practice end-to-end development, database integration, and user experience design—skills that are essential for building scalable business applications in a professional setting.
